            <h3>Presentation</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Bruno Cesar Serafim, and I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for programming. With a strong academic background and experience in purchasing, I have made a career transition to focus on software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, I have acquired valuable knowledge in mechanical engineering and later in software engineering through post-graduate studies. My professional experience includes working as a Senior Buyer at SMP Automotive do Brasil, where I had the opportunity to manage contracts, negotiate with suppliers, and collaborate with various internal departments. I also worked as a Buyer at Buhler, where I was responsible for strategic procurement, international negotiations, and materials management across multiple branches.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my quest to expand my knowledge and skills, I have completed several programming courses, including Android and Java. These courses have provided me with a solid foundation in core concepts and modern technologies such as Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, and MongoDB. Additionally, I have obtained certifications in areas such as Customs Brokerage and Fiscal Training for Buyers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a natural ability to quickly grasp new knowledge, allowing me to adapt easily to new technologies and methodologies. I am a highly motivated, committed individual with a passion for solving complex problems through programming. I possess analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a creative approach to finding efficient and innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my technical profile, I also have strong interpersonal skills developed through my experience in dealing with suppliers, colleagues, and other departments. I am fluent in English, enabling effective communication in international environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my free time, I enjoy engaging in challenging projects, exploring new technologies, and contributing to the developer community through forums and discussion groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently seeking new job opportunities or professional collaboration projects that allow me to apply my passion for programming, technical skills, and previous experience in a challenging and innovative environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are looking for a passionate developer with a solid engineering background and problem-solving skills, I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your project or team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please feel free to contact me using the contact information below. I am open to exciting opportunities and look forward to getting to know you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for visiting, and have a great day!
            </p>
